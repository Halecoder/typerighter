Yesterday’s rain has stopped Australia getting too many on the board before England skittle the last 7 wickets (I can’t see Lyon batting again) for 50 runs before Crawley smashes out the fastest century by an England player in Tests to win just before the close of play.”</p> \n<p>Tongue out of cheek, there could easily be wickets this morning. It’s cloudy and it will take some serious batting to get back in, though a few specks of blue sky have started to appear.</p>"

Although, even now, to call House of Cards a “TV” series feels a little off. Yes, the Kevin Spacey-starring political drama did appear on people’s TV screens, and yes it was serialised, but in other ways it was something entirely new. It wouldn’t be scheduled to air in weekly chunks on an existing channel, but instead would be available to be streamed in one go, without commercial breaks and over high-speed internet to the subscribers of the online video platform of a mail-order DVD subscription company called Netflix.</p> <p>The novelty didn’t just end with that delivery method. Netflix, in bidding for House of Cards, committed to funding two full seasons of the show, an unprecedented move at a time where sitcoms and dramas would routinely be cancelled after a handful of episodes. And there was the $100m price tag, a hefty figure by the standards of established networks, let alone a newcomer dipping its toes into programme-making. Netflix had managed to coax Spacey and a Hollywood auteur – in the show’s director and executive producer David Fincher – on to its nascent platform, and it had given them creative freedom to make what they wanted, with none of the meddling notes usually provided by most TV executives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d940a2fa01b4b8c34c864929cc5f94fc79a0d55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d940a2fa01b4b8c34c864929cc5f94fc79a0d55/0_248_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"House of Cards\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Full stream ahead … House of Cards, one of the first series to break with appointment viewing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Melinda Sue Gordon/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>House of Cards then wasn’t just a glossy political thriller, but the promise of a glorious new age; one where viewers would have blue-chip content available whenever they wanted it (with no ads!), put together by handsomely remunerated, creatively unconstrained talent. The streaming era had arrived and everyone was invited for $8 a month.</p> <p>A decade later, much of the gleam of that era has faded. House of Cards turned out be a superficially classy but ultimately quite hollow prestige TV series with a scandal-ridden lead. And streaming, too, has failed to live up to its potential. In 2023 it’s a model that is malfunctioning, without an easy way of fixing it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Audiences like the end of appointment viewing, they like the one-stop shop, but streaming has produced new complications</p> <footer> <cite>Mattias Frey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Streaming is malfunctioning for viewers. A model that once looked to only have upsides – inexpensiveness, variety, instant accessibility – has become bloated, expensive and confusing. Where once streaming was bunched around a handful of platforms (Netflix, Amazon, BBC iPlayer in the UK, Hulu in the US) now that number<strong> </strong>has ballooned into the double digits, meaning that viewers have to fork out big sums if they want to try to keep up with the continual churn of buzzy, often overhyped, shows.</p> <p>“To make a long story short, people are very dissatisfied by streaming,” says Mattias Frey, head of media, culture and creative industries at City University, London and the author of Netflix Recommends: Algorithms, Film Choice, and the History of Taste. “Audiences like the end of appointment viewing, they like the one-stop shop, but it has produced new complications.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1ca2b178cfb77f32d8a11d8bac8709c946c39e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1ca2b178cfb77f32d8a11d8bac8709c946c39e2/0_185_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"r\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lord of the Rings: the Rings of Power, streaming’s riskiest bet so far.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amazon Prime Studio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Streaming is malfunctioning for the creatives making the shows, too: it’s why the members of the Writers Guild of America, the union representing Hollywood’s screenwriters, are now on strike over their pay and working conditions, with the Screen Actors Guild mulling a strike of its own. While streaming has handsomely paid some of TV’s biggest-name creators like Ryan Murphy or Shonda Rhimes, writers at the lower end of the food chain subsist on relative crumbs – the “back-end” payments they once received when a show they worked on was rebroadcast (or syndicated) to another network having no direct equivalent in the streaming age – while being expected to churn out more shows than ever in an age of peak TV.</p> <p>And remarkably, streaming is malfunctioning for many of the companies doing the streaming. Disney’s streaming arm, Disney+ posted an operating loss of more than $1bn in the first quarter of this year (that figure shrank to a still-pretty-eye-watering <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/disney-cuts-streaming-losses-resurgent-parks-boost-results-2023-05-10/\" title=\"\">loss of $659m</a> in the second quarter). Peacock, the streaming arm of US network NBC, is <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/streaming/news/peacock-losses-3-billion-peak-2023-1235503100/\" title=\"\">expecting to post losses of $3bn</a> this year as it expands its library. Netflix has turned a profit this year but remains saddled with historic debts of around $14bn. As Brian Steinberg, senior TV editor at Variety puts it: “The companies that built [streaming] have done so without the guarantee that they can make a business out of it.”</p> <p>Perhaps more alarmingly for these companies is the fact that Wall Street – whose bullishness around streaming allowed the industry to expand at such a rapid clip (with surging share prices allowing more lending) – seems to have cooled its interest in recent times. A Deloitte report on the future of the industry from earlier this year notes that “investors and executives have accepted that <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/wall-street-streaming-guidance-2023-1235302958/\" title=\"\">streaming is, in fact, not a good business</a> – at least not compared to what came before”.</p> <p>***</p> <p>What came before was a combination of free-to-air and cable – or satellite TV in the UK – that, while by no means perfect, at least had a certain logic to it: what Steinberg calls “a triple revenue stream of advertising, distribution and syndication”, that seemed, by and large, to satisfy the studios producing and selling the shows, the networks broadcasting them and the talent working on them. But then Netflix arrived in 2007<strong> </strong>to disrupt everything.</p> <p>Initially, perhaps doubting Netflix was a threat, the big media companies were willing to license their shows – Friends, Seinfeld, and most significantly for Netflix’s sudden rise, Breaking Bad – out to this plucky new competitor to stream. That willingness soon eroded when they realised just how large that competitor was getting. Cue what Frey describes as the “revenge of the traditional media companies. Netflix had kind of the playing field to itself for a long time. And all of a sudden Disney comes in. And Disney has this huge back catalogue – and it has just bought up 20th Century Fox.”</p> <p>Quickly the old US media giants pulled their shows and films back from Netflix and into their own rapidly growing platforms: Disney+, Peacock, Warner Bros and Discovery’s HBO Max (now just Max), Viacom’s Paramount+. Netflix, lacking a library to match those giants, started churning out original programming of its own: 158 shows and films in 2018, 371 shows and films in 2019, 467 shows and films in 2020. Meanwhile in 2013, Amazon, flush with cash and noticing the potential of streaming to lure consumers to its main businesses, started dipping its toes into the pool, too (dipping its toes in Amazon’s case meant splurging on the most expensive show of all time in the form of the $715m Lord of the Rings: the Rings of Power) later to be joined by another tech giant, Apple.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Once you get people hooked, you need to actually serve as a mass market to achieve economies of scale</p> <footer> <cite>Mattias Frey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The result of this arms race was “peak TV”, a period of seemingly unceasing content: last year saw 599 scripted English-language TV shows being released in the US alone. For many it has been a bewildering era, where it has been impossible to keep up with the amount of programming on offer, creating what cultural critic Anne Helen Petersen described as “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/nov/20/overloaded-is-there-simply-too-much-culture\" title=\"\">a mix of resentment and paralysis</a>” in viewers.</p> <p>In the peak TV era, ambitious, big-budget series with huge names come and go without many of us even knowing they ever existed: See Clare Danes and Tom Hiddleston in Apple TV+’s The Essex Serpent, or Julia Roberts in Gaslit on Lionsgate+ (bonus points to anyone who even knows there is a streaming service called Lionsgate+).</p> <p>Just figuring out where and when to watch these many, many series is a challenge in itself. “There’s no central repository to track where your programme might be,” says Steinberg. “The consumer has to find it for themselves.” And, unlike appointment viewing, there’s no guarantee that you know anyone who is watching it at the same time or pace, if at all.</p> <p>This all may be just about tolerable if the vast majority of this programming was good, but much of it isn’t. TV in the 2020s has been overrun by superheroes, sequels and shows that have what <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2023/06/streaming-industry-netflix-max-disney-hulu-apple-tv-prime-video-peacock-paramount.html\" title=\"\">a savage New York magazine piece</a> on the state of streaming calls the “expensive signifiers of prestige TV”, without any of the quality to underpin it. Of course there are still exemplary shows – Succession, The Bear, Severance – but the proportion of them seems barely any higher than a decade ago, despite the huge upswing in total shows being made.</p> <p>This is perhaps best exemplified by Netflix. Once a place where show-makers could expect creative freedom, it has become more ruthless as it has scaled up and begun chasing a truly global audience. Shows that may have been given time to develop in the company’s earlier years are now cancelled after a season or two. While it still delivers some blindingly ambitious series – such as Beef, the comedy-drama about two strangers drawn into a dangerous feud after a road rage incident – there seems to be a greater focus on the sort of flotsam that usually pads out daytime TV schedules: dating shows, true-crime documentaries, gameshows.</p> <p>“Netflix becoming the new HBO with these amazing new series, that was the initial thing,” says Frey. “But then once you get people hooked, you need to actually serve as a mass market to achieve economies of scale.

Last summer the streamer’s share price plummeted by 35% after 200,000 of its subscribers jumped ship amid the cost of living crisis. Tough decisions have been made, notably a crackdown on password sharing, and the introduction of an advert-supported subscription tier. “For them that is quite radical; they always vowed never to have advertising,” says Steinberg. “They saw a problem last year and are working to correct it. I don’t think they’re out of the woods, but they remain a force in streaming for certain.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>So much of the promise of this venture is quietly being taken down – and if you renege on a promise,  consumers get mad</p> <footer> <cite>Brian Steinberg</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While Netflix has been able to weather its recent storm without cutting down on its enormous programming spend, for others the peak TV party seems to be over.

The BBC foresaw the streaming revolution, launching the iPlayer way back in 2008, and has reaped the rewards, enjoying <a href=\"https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2023/01/30/bbc-iplayer-passed-seven-billion-streams-milestone-in-2022/#close-modal\">7bn streams in 2022</a> alone. Yet the danger from Netflix, in particular, remains acute: according to a National Audit Office report. last year, 25% 16- to 34-year-olds watched iPlayer compared with Netflix on 55%.<strong><br><br></strong>Unlike in the US, where the old media companies have gone to war with their new tech rivals, British broadcasters have sought to work with them, with co-productions that first appear on the BBC or Channel 4, before moving to streamers such as Netflix and Amazon. Equally clever has been the broadcasters’ money-spinning decision to licence their shows to other platforms rather than trying to create unwieldy content libraries of their own like their American counterparts.</p> <p>At the same time, there has been an inability for British media companies to work together to combat the threat from Netflix: Britbox, initially devised as a platform bringing together the best of British broadcasting, ultimately ended up as little more than a repository for the BBC and ITV’s archive material. And the ad-funded free model adopted by most of the non-licence fee-funded British broadcasters is at the risk of the whims of the market: witness <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2023/06/channel-4-executives-defer-bonus-producer-revolt-1235398865/\">the travails of Channel 4</a>, having to cancel shows on the eve of production due to a financial shortfall caused by an ad market slump.</p> <p>Last November, ITV took the biggest swing by a UK broadcaster for some time when it launched its dedicated streaming platform ITVX, which offers original shows alongside content from its linear channels (ITVX is free and ad-funded, but with a premium ad-free tier). With an £800m price tag on launch, it is a bold play at a time when some are concerned that there are already too many streaming platforms for viewers to keep abreast of.</p> <p>“People have an affinity for the ITV brand,” says Rufus Radcliffe, ITV’s managing director of of streaming, interactive and data . We’ve been around for 60 years, people understand there is going to be a quality that you get with ITV that you won’t necessarily get with other services.</p> <p>“I don’t think anyone is denying that it’s a competitive landscape out there. Night after night it’s a competition to win our audiences,” Radcliffe adds.</p> <p>Financially vulnerable and at risk of losing viewers: just how long can this current roster of streamers last? “If there is a worldwide recession, I think a number of these are looking very vulnerable and will fold,” says Frey.</p> <p>Steinberg agrees; “I don’t know if everyone who has jumped into the pool will be able to stay in it for ever.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/23/how-can-i-decide-what-to-watch-on-tv-and-stop-scrolling\">How can I decide what to watch on TV and stop scrolling?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is perhaps a less bruising solution: consolidation, with streamers merging (as was the case with Warner Bros and Discovery forming Max) or even coming together under one platform, as with Spotify in music. That seems unlikely: as Frey points out, rights licensing in film and TV is more complicated than in music, and besides these are big companies – with big egos in the boardrooms.</p> <p>“There’s still a fight going on,” says Steinberg. “These folks aren’t ready to give up quite yet. So consolidation would surprise me but if the economics become worse, who knows where things are going?”</p> <p>Just imagine: all these streamers as channels on one platform, some with ads, some without.

Yet the danger from Netflix, in particular, remains acute: according to a National Audit Office report. last year, 25% 16- to 34-year-olds watched iPlayer compared with Netflix on 55%. Unlike in the US, where the old media companies have gone to war with their new tech rivals, British broadcasters have sought to work with them, with co-productions that first appear on the BBC or Channel 4, before moving to streamers such as Netflix and Amazon. Equally clever has been the broadcasters’ money-spinning decision to licence their shows to other platforms rather than trying to create unwieldy content libraries of their own like their American counterparts. At the same time, there has been an inability for British media companies to work together to combat the threat from Netflix: Britbox, initially devised as a platform bringing together the best of British broadcasting, ultimately ended up as little more than a repository for the BBC and ITV’s archive material. And the ad-funded free model adopted by most of the non-licence fee-funded British broadcasters is at the risk of the whims of the market: witness the travails of Channel 4, having to cancel shows on the eve of production due to a financial shortfall caused by an ad market slump. Last November, ITV took the biggest swing by a UK broadcaster for some time when it launched its dedicated streaming platform ITVX, which offers original shows alongside content from its linear channels (ITVX is free and ad-funded, but with a premium ad-free tier). With an £800m price tag on launch, it is a bold play at a time when some are concerned that there are already too many streaming platforms for viewers to keep abreast of. “People have an affinity for the ITV brand,” says Rufus Radcliffe, ITV’s managing director of of streaming, interactive and data . We’ve been around for 60 years, people understand there is going to be a quality that you get with ITV that you won’t necessarily get with other services. “I don’t think anyone is denying that it’s a competitive landscape out there. Night after night it’s a competition to win our audiences,” Radcliffe adds. Financially vulnerable and at risk of losing viewers: just how long can this current roster of streamers last? “If there is a worldwide recession, I think a number of these are looking very vulnerable and will fold,” says Frey. Steinberg agrees; “I don’t know if everyone who has jumped into the pool will be able to stay in it for ever.”\nThere is perhaps a less bruising solution: consolidation, with streamers merging (as was the case with Warner Bros and Discovery forming Max) or even coming together under one platform, as with Spotify in music. That seems unlikely: as Frey points out, rights licensing in film and TV is more complicated than in music, and besides these are big companies – with big egos in the boardrooms. “There’s still a fight going on,” says Steinberg. “These folks aren’t ready to give up quite yet. So consolidation would surprise me but if the economics become worse, who knows where things are going?” Just imagine: all these streamers as channels on one platform, some with ads, some without. It sounds great, doesn’t it? And an awful lot like … TV.",

                    "html": "<p>Just over 10 years ago, a TV series debuted that would help set in train a revolution in the industry. Although, even now, to call House of Cards a “TV” series feels a little off. Yes, the Kevin Spacey-starring political drama did appear on people’s TV screens, and yes it was serialised, but in other ways it was something entirely new. It wouldn’t be scheduled to air in weekly chunks on an existing channel, but instead would be available to be streamed in one go, without commercial breaks and over high-speed internet to the subscribers of the online video platform of a mail-order DVD subscription company called Netflix.</p> \n<p>The novelty didn’t just end with that delivery method. Netflix, in bidding for House of Cards, committed to funding two full seasons of the show, an unprecedented move at a time where sitcoms and dramas would routinely be cancelled after a handful of episodes. And there was the $100m price tag, a hefty figure by the standards of established networks, let alone a newcomer dipping its toes into programme-making. Netflix had managed to coax Spacey and a Hollywood auteur – in the show’s director and executive producer David Fincher – on to its nascent platform, and it had given them creative freedom to make what they wanted, with none of the meddling notes usually provided by most TV executives.</p>"

While streaming has handsomely paid some of TV’s biggest-name creators like Ryan Murphy or Shonda Rhimes, writers at the lower end of the food chain subsist on relative crumbs – the “back-end” payments they once received when a show they worked on was rebroadcast (or syndicated) to another network having no direct equivalent in the streaming age – while being expected to churn out more shows than ever in an age of peak TV.</p> \n<p>And remarkably, streaming is malfunctioning for many of the companies doing the streaming. Disney’s streaming arm, Disney+ posted an operating loss of more than $1bn in the first quarter of this year (that figure shrank to a still-pretty-eye-watering <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/disney-cuts-streaming-losses-resurgent-parks-boost-results-2023-05-10/\" title=\"\">loss of $659m</a> in the second quarter). Peacock, the streaming arm of US network NBC, is <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/streaming/news/peacock-losses-3-billion-peak-2023-1235503100/\" title=\"\">expecting to post losses of $3bn</a> this year as it expands its library. Netflix has turned a profit this year but remains saddled with historic debts of around $14bn. As Brian Steinberg, senior TV editor at Variety puts it: “The companies that built [streaming] have done so without the guarantee that they can make a business out of it.”</p> \n<p>Perhaps more alarmingly for these companies is the fact that Wall Street – whose bullishness around streaming allowed the industry to expand at such a rapid clip (with surging share prices allowing more lending) – seems to have cooled its interest in recent times. A Deloitte report on the future of the industry from earlier this year notes that “investors and executives have accepted that <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/wall-street-streaming-guidance-2023-1235302958/\" title=\"\">streaming is, in fact, not a good business</a> – at least not compared to what came before”.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>What came before was a combination of free-to-air and cable – or satellite TV in the UK – that, while by no means perfect, at least had a certain logic to it: what Steinberg calls “a triple revenue stream of advertising, distribution and syndication”, that seemed, by and large, to satisfy the studios producing and selling the shows, the networks broadcasting them and the talent working on them. But then Netflix arrived in 2007<strong> </strong>to disrupt everything.</p> \n<p>Initially, perhaps doubting Netflix was a threat, the big media companies were willing to license their shows – Friends, Seinfeld, and most significantly for Netflix’s sudden rise, Breaking Bad – out to this plucky new competitor to stream. That willingness soon eroded when they realised just how large that competitor was getting. Cue what Frey describes as the “revenge of the traditional media companies. Netflix had kind of the playing field to itself for a long time. And all of a sudden Disney comes in. And Disney has this huge back catalogue – and it has just bought up 20th Century Fox.”</p> \n<p>Quickly the old US media giants pulled their shows and films back from Netflix and into their own rapidly growing platforms: Disney+, Peacock, Warner Bros and Discovery’s HBO Max (now just Max), Viacom’s Paramount+. Netflix, lacking a library to match those giants, started churning out original programming of its own: 158 shows and films in 2018, 371 shows and films in 2019, 467 shows and films in 2020. Meanwhile in 2013, Amazon, flush with cash and noticing the potential of streaming to lure consumers to its main businesses, started dipping its toes into the pool, too (dipping its toes in Amazon’s case meant splurging on the most expensive show of all time in the form of the $715m Lord of the Rings: the Rings of Power) later to be joined by another tech giant, Apple.</p>"

                    "html": "<p>The result of this arms race was “peak TV”, a period of seemingly unceasing content: last year saw 599 scripted English-language TV shows being released in the US alone. For many it has been a bewildering era, where it has been impossible to keep up with the amount of programming on offer, creating what cultural critic Anne Helen Petersen described as “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/nov/20/overloaded-is-there-simply-too-much-culture\" title=\"\">a mix of resentment and paralysis</a>” in viewers.</p> \n<p>In the peak TV era, ambitious, big-budget series with huge names come and go without many of us even knowing they ever existed: See Clare Danes and Tom Hiddleston in Apple TV+’s The Essex Serpent, or Julia Roberts in Gaslit on Lionsgate+ (bonus points to anyone who even knows there is a streaming service called Lionsgate+).</p> \n<p>Just figuring out where and when to watch these many, many series is a challenge in itself. “There’s no central repository to track where your programme might be,” says Steinberg. “The consumer has to find it for themselves.” And, unlike appointment viewing, there’s no guarantee that you know anyone who is watching it at the same time or pace, if at all.</p> \n<p>This all may be just about tolerable if the vast majority of this programming was good, but much of it isn’t. TV in the 2020s has been overrun by superheroes, sequels and shows that have what <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2023/06/streaming-industry-netflix-max-disney-hulu-apple-tv-prime-video-peacock-paramount.html\" title=\"\">a savage New York magazine piece</a> on the state of streaming calls the “expensive signifiers of prestige TV”, without any of the quality to underpin it. Of course there are still exemplary shows – Succession, The Bear, Severance – but the proportion of them seems barely any higher than a decade ago, despite the huge upswing in total shows being made.</p> \n<p>This is perhaps best exemplified by Netflix. Once a place where show-makers could expect creative freedom, it has become more ruthless as it has scaled up and begun chasing a truly global audience. Shows that may have been given time to develop in the company’s earlier years are now cancelled after a season or two. While it still delivers some blindingly ambitious series – such as Beef, the comedy-drama about two strangers drawn into a dangerous feud after a road rage incident – there seems to be a greater focus on the sort of flotsam that usually pads out daytime TV schedules: dating shows, true-crime documentaries, gameshows.</p> \n<p>“Netflix becoming the new HBO with these amazing new series, that was the initial thing,” says Frey. “But then once you get people hooked, you need to actually serve as a mass market to achieve economies of scale. Now it seems to be a kind of typical factory.”</p> \n<p>Shows themselves have even taken aim at this state of affairs: in HBO’s brilliant dark comedy Barry, a character’s TV show is cancelled after 12 hours because “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktAbh39aoU8\" title=\"\">the algorithm felt it wasn’t hitting the right taste clusters</a>”, while the latest series of Netflix’s own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/19/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-is-trolling-netflix-and-its-breathtaking\" title=\"\">Black Mirror takes aim</a> at the preponderance of bad true crime and glossy biopics on the platform.</p> \n<p>This recalibration has come at a time when Netflix has had to contend with its first small crisis. Last summer the streamer’s share price plummeted by 35% after 200,000 of its subscribers jumped ship amid the cost of living crisis. Tough decisions have been made, notably a crackdown on password sharing, and the introduction of an advert-supported subscription tier. “For them that is quite radical; they always vowed never to have advertising,” says Steinberg. “They saw a problem last year and are working to correct it. I don’t think they’re out of the woods, but they remain a force in streaming for certain.”</p>"

The writers’ strike has shut down production on shows across the US right as streamers are frantically cutting back on their content, even cancelling shows and films in mid- or post-production in order to claim tax write-offs. There is talk of homegrown<strong> </strong>shows coming off platforms like <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2023/04/disney-streaming-strategy-ceo-bob-iger-marvel-star-wars-disney-pixar-third-parties-1235316609/\" title=\"\">Disney+</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/hbo-maxs-cut-content-to-shift-to-other-streaming-services-as-warner-bros-discovery-prepares-relaunch\" title=\"\">Max</a> to be licensed elsewhere – an echo of TV’s old syndication strategy. And ad tiers have in recent years been quietly introduced to platforms like Disney+ and Sky’s streaming arm, Now. One by one, those big benefits of streaming over TV for the viewer seem to be being watered down.</p> \n<p>“You told consumers: ‘We’d be ad-free and you could watch your show when you liked,’” says Steinberg. “Now it’s: ‘You have to watch ads, and if you don’t watch your show fast enough it will be off the service and sent somewhere else.’ So much of the promise of this new venture is quietly being taken down in some ways – and if you renege on a promise the consumers tend to get mad.”</p> \n<p>And, of course, when consumers get mad, they are likely to switch off – especially when they are already feeling a sense of breaking point with the number of platforms they’re being asked to sign up to. “When you look at the stats in terms of the number of subscriptions that people will take, it’s two, maybe three,” says Frey. “And then rather than take on a fourth, they will replace one.” This switching is made simpler by the fact that, unlike the long contracts with the likes of Sky, you can cancel streaming services with relative ease – part of their appeal but potentially a danger to their future.</p>"

Along with streaming’s big beasts there are smaller, bespoke services such as the horror streamer Shudder to subscribe to, as well as a growing number of ad-supported free streamers like Amazon’s Freevee or PlutoTV.</p> \n<p>In the UK the situation is, on the face of it, a little less parlous than across the pond: the licence fee, and a lingering attachment to broadcast TV, provides something of a buffer against the streaming revolution (although UK viewers are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jun/27/britons-will-soon-spend-more-on-streaming-than-tv-analysts-say\">expected to spend more on streaming</a> than they do on pay TV services such as Sky and Virgin Media by 2025). The BBC foresaw the streaming revolution, launching the iPlayer way back in 2008, and has reaped the rewards, enjoying <a href=\"https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2023/01/30/bbc-iplayer-passed-seven-billion-streams-milestone-in-2022/#close-modal\">7bn streams in 2022</a> alone. Yet the danger from Netflix, in particular, remains acute: according to a National Audit Office report. last year, 25% 16- to 34-year-olds watched iPlayer compared with Netflix on 55%.<strong><br><br></strong>Unlike in the US, where the old media companies have gone to war with their new tech rivals, British broadcasters have sought to work with them, with co-productions that first appear on the BBC or Channel 4, before moving to streamers such as Netflix and Amazon. Equally clever has been the broadcasters’ money-spinning decision to licence their shows to other platforms rather than trying to create unwieldy content libraries of their own like their American counterparts.</p> \n<p>At the same time, there has been an inability for British media companies to work together to combat the threat from Netflix: Britbox, initially devised as a platform bringing together the best of British broadcasting, ultimately ended up as little more than a repository for the BBC and ITV’s archive material. And the ad-funded free model adopted by most of the non-licence fee-funded British broadcasters is at the risk of the whims of the market: witness <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2023/06/channel-4-executives-defer-bonus-producer-revolt-1235398865/\">the travails of Channel 4</a>, having to cancel shows on the eve of production due to a financial shortfall caused by an ad market slump.</p> \n<p>Last November, ITV took the biggest swing by a UK broadcaster for some time when it launched its dedicated streaming platform ITVX, which offers original shows alongside content from its linear channels (ITVX is free and ad-funded, but with a premium ad-free tier). With an £800m price tag on launch, it is a bold play at a time when some are concerned that there are already too many streaming platforms for viewers to keep abreast of.</p> \n<p>“People have an affinity for the ITV brand,” says Rufus Radcliffe, ITV’s managing director of of streaming, interactive and data . We’ve been around for 60 years, people understand there is going to be a quality that you get with ITV that you won’t necessarily get with other services.</p> \n<p>“I don’t think anyone is denying that it’s a competitive landscape out there. Night after night it’s a competition to win our audiences,” Radcliffe adds.</p> \n<p>Financially vulnerable and at risk of losing viewers: just how long can this current roster of streamers last? “If there is a worldwide recession, I think a number of these are looking very vulnerable and will fold,” says Frey.</p> \n<p>Steinberg agrees; “I don’t know if everyone who has jumped into the pool will be able to stay in it for ever.”</p>"

              "bodyTextSummary": "The fatal shooting of a 17-year-old boy of north African descent during a police traffic stop in a Paris suburb, and the four consecutive nights of violence and rioting it has triggered, have once more thrown a spotlight on France’s policing structures and methods. The office of the UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) on Friday became the latest international organisation to criticise French policing, saying the shooting was a “moment for the country to seriously address the deep issues of racism and racial discrimination in law enforcement”. The OHCHR spokesperson, Ravina Shamdasani, said authorities should ensure that the use of police force “always respects the principles of legality, necessity, proportionality, non-discrimination, precaution and accountability”. The death of the teenager, identified as Nahel M, was the third fatal shooting by police during traffic stops in France in 2023. There were a record 13 such shootings last year, three in 2021 and two in 2020. Most of the victims since 2017 have been of black or Arab origin, reinforcing claims by rights groups of systemic racism within French law enforcement agencies. “We have to go beyond saying that things need to calm down,” said Dominique Sopo, the head of the campaign group SOS Racisme. “The issue here is how we to ensure we have a police force that, when they see blacks and Arabs, don’t tend to shout at them [but] use racist terms against them and in some cases shoot them in the head.” Beyond an institutional racism common in many police forces, French policing has a tendency to violence that has been highlighted by groups including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Council of Europe. Police truncheons, teargas grenades, rubber bullets and larger “flash balls” have inflicted extensive physical injuries during demonstrations. Long a taboo subject, French policing – seen by many critics as instinctively repressive and favouring disproportionate force – has become a major political issue, particularly since the gilets jaunes protests of 2018 and 2019 in which an estimated 2,500 protesters were injured, several of whom lost eyes or limbs.",

              "bodyTextSummary": "More than 1,300 people were arrested in a fourth night of violence in France after the police shooting of a 17-year-old boy. Forty-five thousand police officers, including special forces, were deployed to respond to rioting across the country on Friday night, with the situation in two big cities – Marseille and Lyon – highlighted as particularly chaotic, with buildings and vehicles torched and stores looted. The ministry of the interior reported 1,311 people were arrested overnight, while 79 police officers and gendarmes were injured and 2,500 fires were recorded. The unrest flared nationwide after Nahel M, a 17-year-old of Algerian and Moroccan descent, was shot by police on Tuesday during a traffic stop in a Paris suburb. His death, caught on video, has reignited longstanding complaints of police violence and racism. The 38-year-old officer involved in the shooting, who has said he fired the shot because he feared he and his colleague or someone else could be hit by the car, has been charged with voluntary homicide and placed in provisional detention. The funeral ceremony for Nahel began on Saturday with a visitation, and will be followed by a mosque ceremony and burial in a cemetery in Nanterre. The ministry said the protests were “of a lower intensity compared with the previous night”.\n“It’s the republic that will win, not the rioters,” France’s interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, said as he met police in the early hours of Saturday morning. He denounced the “unacceptable violence in Lyon and Marseille”, where public demonstrations were banned and public transport halted. There more than 400 arrests in the capital, with reports of burnt rubbish and violent scuffles in the Les Halles district. More than 80 arrests were made in Marseille, according to the interior ministry, and “significant reinforcements” were sent after the mayor, Benoît Payan, called on the national government to immediately send additional troops.\n“The scenes of pillaging and violence are unacceptable,” Payan tweeted late on Friday, after police clashed with protesters. Local media reported that an Aldi was the target of a looting ram-raid, while authorities said they were investigating the cause of an apparent explosion in the city, which they did not believe caused any casualties. Several rifles were looted from a gun store, but no ammunition was taken. One person was arrested with a rifle that was probably from the store, police said. In Lyon and its surrounding suburbs, rioters set cars ablaze and aimed fireworks at police. Police deployed armoured personnel carriers and a helicopter to quell the unrest in France’s third-largest city.\nNanterre’s mayor, Patrick Jarry, said: “There’s a feeling of injustice in many residents’ minds, whether it’s about school achievement, getting a job, access to culture, housing and other life issues … I believe we are in that moment when we need to face the urgency [of the situation].” Speaking in Mantes-la-Jolie, Darmanin highlighted the young age of many of those taking part in demonstrations. “I do not confuse the few hundred, the few thousand delinquents, often very young unfortunately, with the vast majority of our compatriots who live in working-class neighbourhoods, who want to work and educate their children,” he said. The French football team urged an end to the violence on Friday night. “The time of violence must give way to that of mourning, dialogue and reconstruction,” the team said in a statement posted on social media by their captain, Kylian Mbappé.\nThe team said they were “shocked by the brutal death of young Nahel” but asked that violence give way to “other peaceful and constructive ways of expressing oneself”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, left an EU summit in Brussels early on Friday to attend a crisis meeting. He urged parents to keep their children at home and accused social media companies of playing a “considerable role”, saying violence was being organised online. He asked platforms such as Snapchat and TikTok to remove sensitive content. Macron is under mounting pressure from rightwing parties to declare a state of emergency, which would give authorities extra powers to ban demonstrations and limit free movement. Asked on Friday night whether the government could declare a state of emergency, Darmanin said: “We’re not ruling out any hypothesis and we’ll see after tonight what the president of the republic chooses.” Darmanin said on Saturday he was cautious about such an order, which “has been called four times in 60 years”. Analysts said the government was desperate to avoid a repeat of 2005, when a state of emergency was declared after the death of two boys of African origin in a police chase sparked three weeks of rioting.

              "bodyTextSummary": "Ministers have ordered a Cambridgeshire council to end its “experiment” with a four-day working week. South Cambridgeshire district council had announced plans to extend its trial until next April but ministers have ordered officials to end it now. The Liberal Democrat-led council was the first local authority in the UK to undertake such a trial. The local government minister, Lee Rowley, wrote to the council leader, Bridget Smith, to “ask that you end your experiment immediately” and said he had concerns about the “value for money” for local taxpayers. There has been growing interest in a four-day week in the UK and globally, with some businesses praising the shift to a shorter working week. But in a letter dated 30 June, Rowley said such a model was inappropriate for local authorities. “As I am sure you are aware, all councils are expected to ensure that finite and valuable taxpayers’ money is used in a way which demonstrates value for money – something which paying employees for an extra day of work that is not carried out is unlikely to demonstrate,” he wrote. “I strongly believe in the ability of councils to innovate and find new ways to discharge their responsibilities – yet removing up to 20% of the capacity to do those activities is not something which should be acceptable for a council seeking to demonstrate value for money for its taxpayers and residents. “Whilst some private-sector organisations may choose to experiment with their own capital and capacity regarding ‘four-day working weeks’, local government should not do the same.” He said such an approach could breach the council’s legal duties under the Local Government Act. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing & Communities would “shortly be issuing clear guidance” on the matter, Rowley added. “I look forward to your confirmation that South Cambridgeshire will be returning to established norms around local government workforce capacity in the coming weeks ahead,” he said. Smith said: “I was surprised to receive Mr Rowley’s letter and we have written to him to request a meeting with ministers to discuss this matter. This is a trial, but we have already seen strong independently assessed evidence which showed that performance was maintained, and in some cases improved, in the first three months. “At the start of our trial we were carrying a £2m annual agency bill. During the first three months of the trial, we filled four permanent posts that had previously been impossible to fill. This has reduced our annual bill by £300,000. As time goes on it is becoming increasingly clear that recruitment has been positively affected, both in terms of the quality and number of applicants, and the consequent success in filling vacant posts.” Jolyon Maugham, the director of the Good Law project, said: “This is bar-stool lawyering par excellence. If Lee Rowley really wants to improve the quality of work funded by the taxpayer, I’d suggest in the future he gets proper independent legal advice before he opines on the law.” He added: “If a legal challenge is brought, and succeeds, I’ll eat my wig.”\nJoe Ryle, the director of the 4-Day Week campaign group, said: “This move by the government flies in the face of all the evidence, which shows the four-day week has been a huge success at the council. “The four-day week with no loss of pay is already beingrolled out across the private sector, so it’s only fair the public sector are included too.

This is a trial, but we have already seen strong independently assessed evidence which showed that performance was maintained, and in some cases improved, in the first three months.</p> \n<p>“At the start of our trial we were carrying a £2m annual agency bill. During the first three months of the trial, we filled four permanent posts that had previously been impossible to fill. This has reduced our annual bill by £300,000. As time goes on it is becoming increasingly clear that recruitment has been positively affected, both in terms of the quality and number of applicants, and the consequent success in filling vacant posts.” </p> \n<p>Jolyon Maugham, the director of the Good Law project, said: “This is bar-stool lawyering par excellence. If Lee Rowley really wants to improve the quality of work funded by the taxpayer, I’d suggest in the future he gets proper independent legal advice before he opines on the law.”</p> \n<p>He added: “If a legal challenge is brought, and succeeds, I’ll eat my wig.”</p>"

The irony is that this trial is already bringing many benefits to council workers, local residents and saving the council money.”</p> \n<p>Smith recently told the BBC that the move to carry out the trial came after years of relying on agency staff to fill the gaps left by vacancies.</p> \n<p>“On average, we only fill about 80% and we have some vacancies that we have been carrying for years, particularly in planning,” she told the broadcaster. “We had to do something. We have already managed to deliver a third of a million pounds in savings, largely because we’ve now filled some of those really difficult to fill roles within planning.”</p> \n<p>South Cambridgeshire district council has been contacted for comment.</p>"
